# ShiXun

Because I have write all the methods and my thinking in my blog, I just write the path of the codes here.
Please read my blog.

## Ant
build.xml is in week1/test
HelloWorld.java is in week1/test/src

## Java code
it is in week1/EasyCalculator

## JUint
it is in week1/JUnitTest

## Sonar
it is in week1/Sonar
There are five files in it, each file has its own Part? file and sonar-project.properties. Because we have the course for us to deal with it, so I don't decide to describe it.

Thanks for reading.
